## Project Purpose

Replicalc is primarily developed to meet my own needs, but contributions are welcome under these terms.

## Bug Reports

Please raise [an issue](https://github.com/dHeinemann/Replicalc/issues), and I will investigate when time permits; or
feel free to submit [a pull request](https://github.com/dHeinemann/Replicalc/pulls) directly.

## Feature Requests

Unfortunately, I do not have sufficient free time to implement new features for others. However, pull requests that
align with the goals of the project are welcome (see below). Small and simple feature requests may be submitted
directly as pull requests. For anything complex (or if in doubt), please raise an issue first for discussion.

## Project Goals

**Simplicity**

Replicalc is designed to be simple, and lightweight.

**Supported Platforms**

Replicalc must support both Linux and Windows. Support for the BSDs and MacOS is desirable, but not an explicit goal.

**User Interface**

Adding a GUI is not a short- or medium-term goal, but it's something I may consider in the future. A GUI would be an
alternative to the current terminal user interface, rather than replace it. It would have the same features, and
largely work in the same way, except it would have a menu bar and buttons to make configuration easier for
non-programmers.

## Licensing

By submitting a pull request, you agree to make your code available under the same [license](LICENSE) as the
Replicalc project (GPL v2.0).
